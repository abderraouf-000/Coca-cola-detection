## data collection
In this step, we have used Roboflow datasets.

# Data preprocessing
+ Verifying that data has no missing values.
+ Splitting our data to Train/test data .

# Training model
30 epochs, with 200 images as the batch size.

# Model evaluation
We have evaluated our model using MaP evaluation metrirc, getting 75% of accuracy as a result.













Bearing in mind that the train/test/validation data is private on Kaggle.
